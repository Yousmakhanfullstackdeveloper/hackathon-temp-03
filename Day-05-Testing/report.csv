"<input type=""image""> elements have [alt] text"
"When an image is being used as an <input> button, providing alternative text can help screen reader users understand the"
purpose of the button. Learn about input image alt text.
Form elements have associated labels
"Labels ensure that form controls are announced properly by assistive technologies, like screen readers. Learn more about"
form element labels.
Links are distinguishable without relying on color.

users with low vision. Learn how to make links distinguishable.
Links have a discernible name
"Link text (and alternate text for images, when used as links) that is discernible, unique, and focusable improves the"
navigation experience for screen reader users. Learn how to make links accessible.
Lists contain only <li> elements and script supporting elements (<script> and <template>).
Screen readers have a specific way of announcing lists. Ensuring proper list structure aids screen reader output. Learn more
about proper list structure.
"List items (<li>) are contained within <ul>, <ol> or <menu> parent elements"
"Screen readers require list items (<li>) to be contained within a parent <ul>, <ol> or <menu> to be announced properly."
Learn more about proper list structure.
"The document does not use <meta http-equiv=""refresh"">"
about:blank 20/28
"2/2/25, 9:37 PM about:blank"
"Users do not expect a page to refresh automatically, and doing so will move focus back to the top of the page. This may"
create a frustrating or confusing experience. Learn more about the refresh meta tag.
<object> elements have alternate text
Screen readers cannot translate non-text content. Adding alternate text to <object> elements helps screen readers convey
meaning to users. Learn more about alt text for object elements.
Select elements have associated label elements.
Form elements without effective labels can create frustrating experiences for screen reader users. Learn more about the
select element.
Skip links are focusable.
Including a skip link can help users skip to the main content to save time. Learn more about skip links.
No element has a [tabindex] value greater than 0
"A value greater than 0 implies an explicit navigation ordering. Although technically valid, this often creates frustrating"
experiences for users who rely on assistive technologies. Learn more about the tabindex attribute.
"<th> elements and elements with [role=""columnheader""/""rowheader""] have data cells they describe."
Screen readers have features to make navigating tables easier. Ensuring table headers always refer to some set of cells
may improve the experience for screen reader users. Learn more about table headers.

Missing source maps for large first-party JavaScript
"Source maps translate minified code to the original source code. This helps developers debug in production. In addition,"
Lighthouse is able to provide further insights. Consider deploying source maps to take advantage of these benefits. Learn

Uses HTTPS
"All sites should be protected with HTTPS, even ones that don't handle sensitive data. This includes avoiding mixed content,"
where some resources are loaded over HTTP despite the initial request being served over HTTPS. HTTPS prevents
"intruders from tampering with or passively listening in on the communications between your app and your users, and is a"
prerequisite for HTTP/2 and many new web platform APIs. Learn more about HTTPS.
Avoids deprecated APIs
Deprecated APIs will eventually be removed from the browser. Learn more about deprecated APIs.
